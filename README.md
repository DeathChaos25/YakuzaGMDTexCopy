# YakuzaGMDTexCopy
Simple tool for copying textures from a Yakuza .gmd model file for use with mods  

Note: When picking source folder for textures, you do NOT need to specifically pick the folder where the textures are in the chara.par output folder, you can simply select the chara.par output folder and the program will search every directory and subdirectory for texture files, this can avoid weird scenarios where some textures are split such as Nishitani's model from Gaiden where some textures are in the 00 folder and some are in the 01, in this case if you simply pick the chara par output folder and not the dds 00 folder specifically, the program will successfully copy everything.
